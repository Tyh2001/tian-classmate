## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

**Fighting Design**

- The use of ESLint and Prettier tools makes the code clean and easy to read, reducing maintenance costs. We have also created a customized eslint configuration package for this purpose, which is convenient for developers to download and use.
- Both variables and functions have detailed jsDoc annotations, and the parameters and return values of the functions have type markers.
- Using Monoreto to manage various modules of a project improves code reusability, collaboration, and development speed. The parameters of the component have undergone strict type validation and parameter error prompts have been added to improve problem-solving time.
- Encapsulated tool functions for type verification and Props parameter setting methods. In order to improve packaging speed, we optimized the vite configuration file and implemented CSS backward compatibility processing using PostCSS.

**Ai E Assistant**

- Ai E Assistant is a real-time interactive communication platform between doctors and patients.
- Developed by collecting pain points from doctors and patients, market and actual needs, resulting in a 20% increase in user satisfaction.
- Due to the large size of the package, the release failed. I have developed subcontracting specifications for each module.
